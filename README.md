## 📝 Overview

This smart contract implements a decentralized **Multi-Signature Wallet** on the **Stacks blockchain**, providing a secure and collaborative asset management solution for multiple stakeholders.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔒 **Multi-Signature Approval**: Transactions require multiple signatures from authorized owners
- 👥 **Flexible Owner Management**: Add and track authorized wallet owners
- 🔄 **Comprehensive Transaction Control**: Submit, approve, execute, and cancel transactions
- 📊 **Detailed Transaction Tracking**: Monitor transaction status, amount, recipient, and signature progress

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Error Handling
The contract includes robust error management with specific error constants:
- Unauthorized access prevention
- Duplicate signature detection
- Insufficient signature tracking
- Invalid transaction validation

### Core Components
- **Approval Threshold**: Configurable minimum signatures required
- **Dynamic Owner Management**: Flexible owner list maintenance
- **Secure Transaction Records**: Comprehensive transaction state tracking

## 🛠️ Function Overview

### Initialization
- `initialize(owners-list, threshold)`: Set up the multi-signature wallet with initial owners and approval requirements

### Owner Management
- `add-owner(new-owner)`: Add new authorized owners
- `get-authorized-owners()`: Retrieve current authorized owners
- `get-owners-count()`: Count total authorized owners

### Transaction Workflow
- `submit-transaction(recipient, amount)`: Initiate a new transaction
- `approve-transaction(transaction-id)`: Sign and approve transactions
- `execute-transaction(transaction-id)`: Complete approved transactions
- `cancel-transaction(transaction-id)`: Cancel pending transactions
- `get-transaction-details(transaction-id)`: Retrieve transaction information

## 🚀 Usage Example

```clarity
;; Initialize wallet with 3 owners, 2-signature threshold
(initialize 
  [owner1, owner2, owner3] 
  2)

;; Submit a transaction
(submit-transaction 
  'recipient-address 
  1000)

;; Approve the transaction
(approve-transaction transaction-id)

;; Execute when threshold met
(execute-transaction transaction-id)
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Requires multiple signatures to execute transactions
- Transparent owner and transaction management
- Prevents unauthorized asset transfers

## 🔍 Security Audit

This contract has been subjected to thorough security audits and testing, including:

- **Code review** for potential vulnerabilities
- **Manual testing** of edge cases
- **Automated testing** for regression and stability

### Known Vulnerabilities
- The contract has no known vulnerabilities, but it is recommended to regularly audit the contract and the Stacks blockchain for any new security risks.

## ⚠️ Contract Limitations

- Maximum of 20 owners supported
- No automatic owner deactivation mechanism
- Requires manual owner management

## 🌟 Use Case Scenario

**Scenario**: A startup's treasury wallet
- 3 founders as owners
- 2-signature threshold for fund transfers
- Prevents unilateral financial decisions
- Ensures collaborative financial governance

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Ensure Stacks development environment
2. Clone the repository
3. Deploy the smart contract
4. Initialize with desired owners and threshold

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement improvements
4. Submit a pull request

### Contribution Guidelines
- Follow Stacks blockchain best practices
- Maintain code quality
- Provide comprehensive test coverage

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Unable to Submit a Transaction
**Solution**: Ensure that you have met the signature threshold for the transaction. Check the owner count and threshold settings.

### Issue: Incorrect Transaction Execution
**Solution**: Confirm that all required owners have signed the transaction before attempting to execute it.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I change the threshold for approval?
You can change the threshold by updating the smart contract with a new threshold value and re-deploying it.

### Can I add more than 20 owners?
No, the contract currently supports a maximum of 20 owners. This limit is imposed to optimize contract performance.
